v0.7.1
======

.. note::

  v0.7.1 is not yet released. This page reflects changes on the current
  :code:`main` branch that will eventually be a part of v0.7.1.

* Relaxed checks made on :code:`X` in :code:`_validate_and_reformat_input()`
  since that is the concern of the underlying estimator and not Fairlearn.
* Add support for Python 3.9
* Added new `make_sensitive_classification()` in `fairlearn.datasets` to allow
  for creation of a dataset with user-selected number of features.
